            <h1>Weight Training</h1>
            <img class="weights" src="Lifting.jpg" alt="Deadlifting 315lbs">

            <p>I work in Phyical Therapy and I have fallen in love with how the human body works and operates.
                So
                much
                so that I also fell in love with weight lifting. Nothing like lifting a heavy weight and feeling
                like a
                greek god to boost your confidence! Since I work in PT, I focused alot of my training around
                functional
                mobility and training. Keeping yourself mobile and functional is a great way to make sure you
                stay
                safe
                and avoid injuries. Which, I have had my fair share of hahaha. But I was really proud to hit
                this
                milestone, a 315lb deadlift. It's definitely not the heaviest weight ever lifted, but being able
                to
                perform this safely after an injury really makes me feel proud of what I was able to accomplish!

            <h1>Cooking/baking</h1>
            <img class="cooking" src="cooking.jpg" alt="armadillo eggs">
            <p>Ever since I was a kid I LOVED to cook. I used to watch the food network channel all the time and my all
                time favorite show was called Good Eats hosted by Alton Brown. I would be obsessed with the science
                behind how food was made and would experiment in my kitchen any chance I got. I later took a cooking
                class in high school for 2 years and then ended about helping teach the class for my last 2 years of
                high school. Plus I got free food! </p>
            <p>I kept honing my skills in the kitchen and I feel VERY confident in my skills that I feel like I can
                recreate most advanced recipes! Pictured above is one of those recreations called Armadillo Eggs. No,
                they don't actually have armadillo eggs in them, but they are also called Texas Twinkies for some
                reason? Anyway, it is a jalapeno pepper stuffed with pepperjack cream cheese, then it's wrapped in
                italian sausage, AND THEN wrapped in bacon! The italian sausage is seasoned with my homemade BBQ
                seasoning and I dusted a little bit of that on top of the back as well. Let me tell you, this is
                practically a heart attack waiting to happen. It's a good thing I know CPR!!

            <h1>Traveling</h1>
            <img class="travel" src="travel.jpg" alt="view of a lake">
            <p>I've been trying to travel more as I get older. The one thing my elderly patients tell me is that I
                shouldn't wait to travel and to do it while I am young. Well, I guess I've been taking that advice to
                heart since I have been traveling a lot more. There is so much to see in this world and I want to
                experience as much as I can before I am unable too. This photo was taken on my most recent trip to
                Minnesota. There is a hiking trail called Superior Lake Hiking and on that route there are two beautiful
                lakes called Bean and Bear Lake. This is Bean lake and it was absolutely breath-taking to see. Don't get
                me wrong, it was one heck of hike to get to the spot, but man was it work the trek.</p>

            <h1>Cats</h1>
            <img class="cat" src="Cat.jpg" alt="cat picture">
            <p>Look at this distinguished gentleman! This is Ace, named after the famous pet detective. He's a 9 y/o
                slim boy who somehow manages to be be chonky at the same time. I wasn't always a fan of cats growing up
                and I was definetly more of a dog person. But since I wasn't allowed to get a dog as a pet when I was
                kid, I decided to settle for a cat. Next best thing right? Well, it turned out to be a great decision
                since he's basically a dog in cat's clothing hahaha. Seriously, he loves to play fetch and he does love
                to get belly scratches too! 10/10, would pet again! </p>
